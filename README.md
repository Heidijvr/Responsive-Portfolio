## Responsive-Portfolio

In this app, I created two different portfolios. The first portfolio was layed out using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio unit with a mobile-responsive layout ([Use the Responsive-Portfolio:smiley:](https://heidijvr.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)).
This project is part of the front-end curriculum for the University of Washington Part-time Coding Bootcamp.
