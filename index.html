            "I am a full-stack web developer living in Seattle, WA. I spend my days with my hands in different areas of web development ranging from back end programming to front end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.Js).
            </p>
            <p>
            My previous involvement in the creative arts as pianist and piano teacher (M Mus), contributes to the artistic value of web design; my additional my studies in psychology (Psych hons), adds to my sensitivity and comprehension of the userâ€™s needs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Aside from web development and design, I enjoy spending time with my husband and daughter, hiking, traveling, taking photos, and attending classical music concerts; and I look forward to my annual visit to my family in my beautiful home town, Cape Town, South Africa."
