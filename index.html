            "I am a full-stack web developer living in Seattle, WA. I spend my days with my hands in different areas of web development ranging from back end programming to front end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery).
            </p>
            <p>
            My previous involvement in the creative arts as a pianist and piano teacher (M Mus) contributes to the artistic value of the web design; combined with my studies in psychology (Psych hons), which adds additional sensitivity and comprehension to the userâ€™s needs.
            </p>
            <p>
            Aside from web development and design, I enjoy spending time with my husband and daughter, hiking, traveling, taking photos, and attending classical music concerts; and I look forward to visiting my family in my home town, Cape Town, South Africa, each year.
